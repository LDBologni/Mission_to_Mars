# M10_Mission_to_Mars - Module 10 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

The purpose of the project is to scrape news articles and images of Mars from NASA and other websites and delivers. After scraping images at the highest resolution and news articles there would be transferred to the website in order to display to the audience. 

### Results

The tools developed use MongoDB, a non-relational database to store the articles and images. Each scrape that takes place creates records in the database which are then rendered on the web using the flask application.
